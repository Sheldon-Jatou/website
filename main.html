<!--PROJECTS-->
<div id="projects">
	<h1 class="bordered">Projects</h1>
	<p>
		Projects listed on my <a href="https://github.com/Sheldon-Jatou">GitHub</a> include; <br>
		<b>Hangman (Python)</b> a command line version of the hangman game I made the
		summer before my first year of university, as a way to teach myself Python.<br>
		<b>Weighted Grade Calculator (Python)</b> is a GUI program to determine a final mark
		in a class based on your grades and their weights, also providing the UofT GPA assocaited
		with the grade. I made this after my first year of University to teach myself how to
		make a simple GUI program.<br>
		<b>Reliable Data Transfer & Distance Vector Algorithms (C)</b> are two class projects
		done in my third year for my Computer Networking course. Since they are school work, 
		they were done in private repositories to make working with my partner for the projects
		easier. They both include reports on the algorithms and their time and space complexity.<br>
		<br>
		Academic projects include;<br>
		<b>EXT2 File System (C)</b> for a third year Operating Systems course, the final project
		was to implement several command line functions for a simulated EXT2 File System, such 
		as cat, ls, ln, mv, mkdir, rm , rmdir, and a version of fscheck. Each function involved using and 
		maintaining the file system's block and inode tables, assigning blocks and inodes to
		newly created files and directories, and ensuring that the counts of free blocks and
		inodes remains accurate using bitwise operations on binary strings representing the 
		file system tables. <br>

		<b>Proxy Server (Python)</b> for a third year Computer Networking course, one project
		was to create a proxy server in Python. The server would recieve HTTP GET requests 
		through TCP, modify the request, and forward it to the desitnation. Once the requested
		files are recieved, the server would place them in the cache for a set amount of time,
		then finally send the file to the client. If the requested file was first found in the
		cache, and its timer is not up, then it would be sent to the client without forwarding
		the request. If the timer is up, the cached file is deleted and the request is made
		for a fresh version. Part of the project requirements was also to inject HTML into 
		the file before sending it back to the client to indicate if the file was taken from
		the cache or if it was fresh.<br>
